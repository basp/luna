This is a Go implementation of the ray tracer described in the fantastic book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/) by Jamis Buck.

This project has no explict goal apart from me getting more familiar with Go and doing a cool project in the process. This project would have taken a lot longer was it not for the awesome folks at  [go-gl](https://github.com/go-gl/mathgl) who made the `mgl64` package which forms the foundation for this ray tracer.
